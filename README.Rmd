This is a data package containing character interaction data for a number of popular films. The package is designed to play well with the `charinet` package for character interaction network analysis (under development), but the data can be used for any purpose.

The films currently contained in the package are:

* the first 18 films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (from _Iron Man_ (2008) to _Black Panther_ (2018)); 
* the 4 films in _The Hunger Games_ series (2012-2015); 
* the 3 _Tomb Raider_ films, including the two _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider_ films (2001-2003) as well as the 2018 reboot; 
* 5 miscellaneous other films (*Frozen* (2013), _The Breakfast Club_ (1985), _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ (2015), _Alien_ (1979), and _Wonder Woman_ (2017).
 
The data were gathered as part of my research on using character networks to study the representation of women in film. To learn more about that research, a good place to start is [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2018.1510846).

#### Format

Each film is stored as a list containing three elements:

1. The event list. Each row contains information on a line of dialogue, with columns corresponding to `eventID`, `sceneID`, `speakerID`, and dummy variables for each recipient.
2. The node list. Rows correspond to named speaking characters, with columns corresponding to variables for ID, name, total lines spoken (`nlines`), total times spoken to (`linesin`), and gender.
3. The adjacency matrix. This is derived from the event list through aggregation and can be useful for static purposes such as visualising the network as a sociogram.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pj398/movienetdata")
```
## Example

Load data:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(movienetdata)
data("marvel_01", package = "movienetdata")

# or assign the data
iron_man <- movienetdata::marvel_01
```

Access specific elements by name or by indexing the list:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Get the nodes by name
marvel_01$node_list
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Get the nodes by indexing
marvel_01[[2]]
```

Browse the full list of movies by running:

```{r eval = FALSE}
data(package = "movienetdata")
```


## Usage

Feel free to use the data for whatever you want. To cite the data, either cite the package directly (e.g. via `citation(package = "movienetdata")`) or the relevant publication from my associated research.
